Little Susie,MichaelJackson,Somebody killed little Susie The girl with the tune Who sings in the daytime at noon She was there screaming Beating her voice in her doom But nobody came to her soon  A fall down the stairs Her dress torn Oh the blood in her hair A mystery so sullen in air She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care  Oh the blood in her hair  Everyone came to see The girl that now is dead So blind stare the eyes in her head And suddenly a voice from the crowd said This girl lived in vain Her face bear such agony  such strain  But only the man from next door Knew Little Susie and how he cried As he reached down To close Susie s eyes She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair  It was all for God s sake For her singing the tune For someone to feel her despair To be damned to know hoping is dead and you re doomed Then to scream out And nobody s there  She knew no one cared  Father left home  poor mother died Leaving Susie alone Grandfather s soul too had flown No one to care Just to love her How much can one bear Rejecting the needs in her prayers  Neglection can kill Like a knife in your soul Oh it will Little Susie fought so hard to live She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care So young and so fair,somebody killed little susie the girl with the tune who sings in the daytime at noon she was there screaming beating her voice in her doom but nobody came to her soon  a fall down the stairs her dress torn oh the blood in her hair a mystery so sullen in air she lie there so tenderly fashioned so slenderly lift her with care  oh the blood in her hair  everyone came to see the girl that now is dead so blind stare the eyes in her head and suddenly a voice from the crowd said this girl lived in vain her face bear such agony  such strain  but only the man from next door knew little susie and how he cried as he reached down to close susie s eyes she lie there so tenderly fashioned so slenderly lift her with care oh the blood in her hair  it was all for god s sake for her singing the tune for someone to feel her despair to be damned to know hoping is dead and you re doomed then to scream out and nobody s there  she knew no one cared  father left home  poor mother died leaving susie alone grandfather s soul too had flown no one to care just to love her how much can one bear rejecting the needs in her prayers  neglection can kill like a knife in your soul oh it will little susie fought so hard to live she lie there so tenderly fashioned so slenderly lift her with care so young and so fair
